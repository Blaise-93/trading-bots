## To start up the server in development:
In development environment, you can start up the server on your local machine by running:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
celery -A celery_worker worker -l info
```
You can use already generated swaggarUI docs - localhost:8000/docs/default to make some API calls
and test the program locally or even on the production server too, https://trading-bot.blaisemart.com/docs/

For database migrations and migrate, we are using alembic library to achieve that.

alembic upgrade head # will commit the migrate to db.
